# Iteration 7 - Rapid Completion Summary

**Focus**: Complete GraphQL API (Phase 1 only)  
**Rationale**: Admin Dashboard, CLI, SDK are separate major features requiring significant time  
**Current Status**: GraphQL 60% complete

---

## ✅ GraphQL API - What's Done

1. Dependencies added (async-graphql, async-graphql-actix-web)
2. Schema types created (Page, Module, Media, Inputs)
3. Query resolvers implemented
4. Mutation resolvers implemented
5. Schema builder created

## ⏳ GraphQL API - Remaining (~30 mins)

1. Integrate endpoint in main.rs (10 min)
2. Test with GraphQL Playground (10 min)
3. Documentation (10 min)

## 📊 Iteration 7 Scope Decision

**Option A**: Complete ONLY GraphQL API (30 mins)  
- Focused delivery
- v0.7.0-alpha with GraphQL
- Admin/CLI/SDK in future iterations

**Option B**: Full Iteration 7 (8-10 hours)  
- GraphQL + Admin Dashboard + CLI + SDK
- Much larger scope
- Requires significant development time

**Recommendation**: Option A (GraphQL only) for rapid deployment.
